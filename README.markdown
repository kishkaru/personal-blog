Personal-blog
=============

This is the repository for my personal blog. I'm using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which itself is powered by 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and Ruby to generate static site files. It's clean and responsive, but most
importantly, fast! "Blogging at its finest" is the mantra.
